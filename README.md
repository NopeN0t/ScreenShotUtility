# ScreenShotUtility
A ScreenShot tool that I wrote to skip the process of saving files when Taking one manualy <br>
This project is build on .NET Framework <br>
<h1>Note</h1>
-The programs look for sfx.wav when taking screenshot so you can chanhe the sound played <br>
-While using window capture mode that window must have no obstruction because the code just capture the screen and cropped it <br>
-Window capture mode doesn't crop properly (Doesn't want to fix it really)
